# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detector

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to classify emails as either **"Spam"** or **"Ham"** (not spam). It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the Enron email dataset to make predictions. The application is deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit.

##  Project Overview

The core of this project is a binary classification model. The process involves several key machine learning steps:
1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** The Enron email dataset is loaded, cleaned of missing values, and prepared for processing.
2.  **Text Preprocessing:** Email text is normalized by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, removing common stop words, and applying stemming to reduce words to their root form.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** The cleaned text is converted into a numerical format using the **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** technique.
4.  **Model Training & Evaluation:** Multiple models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM) were trained and evaluated. The SVM model was selected as the best performer with an accuracy of over 98%.
5.  **Deployment:** The trained TF-IDF vectorizer and SVM model were saved and deployed as a web application using Streamlit Cloud.
